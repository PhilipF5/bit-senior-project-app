## Technology Stack

The front end for this project is hosted in this repo consists of both web and native apps. These apps are built and deployed using a single codebase by the [Ionic Framework](http://ionicframework.com), which uses [Angular](http://angular.io) (HTML5, [Sass](http://sass-lang.com), and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org)) on top of the [Apache Cordova](https://cordova.apache.org) hybrid platform. The apps also make use of the [Chart.js](http://www.chartjs.org), [Moment Timezone](http://momentjs.com/timezone/), and [randomColor](https://randomcolor.llllll.li/) JavaScript libraries.

The back end is powered by [ASP.NET Core MVC](https://www.asp.net/core) running on the [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com) cloud. The apps communicate with it via a RESTful API, which the underlying C# code uses to query and/or manipulate a PostgreSQL database running on [Heroku Postgres](https://www.heroku.com/postgres). The back end is not available in this repo.
